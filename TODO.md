#TODO list

* Improve sorting

### Swish's suggestions

* Have a way for user to edit their profile on the site, with options such as saying their available times, game mode preferences, prefer ranked vs unranked, personal skill level, preference as to playing with lower skill levels, their skill, or higher skill levels, etc
* Have a search option to view all the user’s profiles
* Allow users to make preferences private, but not the fact that they use the site
* Give certain users advanced permissions, such as being able to suspend or ban other users. Probably I would be one of those users but it is up to you whom you choose.
* Add a “Commendation” section to user’s profiles, for different categories such as “Teaching”, “Friendly”, etc
* Add a report option to user’s profiles with the website admins being able to see who submitted the report. Have options such as “Communications abuse”, “Intentional Feeding”, “Other (with an option to write in text)”, and a required text box in which they need to detail why they are reporting someone. This will help us weed out people who do not belong with us chill friendly people
* Like how you mentioned in the message to me, we might want to work on the wording of the rule/requirements list the pops up when you log in for the first time.
* Also have the rule page be viewable as a page on the website itself, perhaps have a tab near the top where you currently have “Home” that says “Rules” and have a copy of the rules there
