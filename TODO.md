#TODO list

* Improve sorting
* When clicking "Edit profiles", have current values displayed as default.
* Report buttons
* Heroes on profiles

### Swish's suggestions

* Have a search option to view all the userâ€™s profiles
* Allow users to make preferences private, but not the fact that they use the site
* Give certain users advanced permissions, such as being able to suspend or ban other users.
* Like how you mentioned in the message to me, we might want to work on the wording of the rule/requirements list the pops up when you log in for the first time.
